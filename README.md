# Potato_Leaf_Disease_Classification

### Project planning and flowchart
The project report for potato leaf disease classification is uploaded as a part of repository above.
The main aim of the project is build a model which can classify the disease associated with potato leaf.i.e Early Blight and Late Blight disease.
I have trained Convolution Neural Network in order to perform the task of image classification.
The flowchart of the project is given below:-

### Project model building,testing and predicting
Hereby i have followed the above given flowchart throughout the project.
After the successful completion of model training i moved towards model testing and actual prediction operation.
I would like to attach my final output below:
