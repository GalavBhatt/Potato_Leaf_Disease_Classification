# Potato_Leaf_Disease_Classification

The project report for potato leaf disease classification is uploaded as a part of repository above.
The main aim of the project is build a model which can classify the disease associated with potato leaf.i.e Early Blight and Late Blight disease.
I have trained Convolution Neural Network in order to perform the task of image classification.
The flowchart of the project is given below:-
